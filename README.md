Project Salary Insight 

aims to analyze employee salaries in relation to project budgets and departmental averages. The project involves writing SQL queries to identify various salary-related insights, such as employees earning more than their colleagues, departments with salary discrepancies, and projects with specific budget constraints. By leveraging Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and complex joins, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of salary distributions and their impact on project assignments and departmental budgets.
